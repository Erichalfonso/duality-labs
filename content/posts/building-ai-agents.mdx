# Building AI agents that actually ship value

Over the past year, we've built and deployed AI automation systems for companies ranging from seed-stage startups to established businesses. Here's what we've learned about making AI agents that actually work in production.

## 1. Start with the outcome, not the technology

The most successful AI projects we've shipped started with a clear business outcome:

- "Reduce time spent processing support tickets by 70%"
- "Automatically extract data from 500+ invoice formats"
- "Generate first-draft responses to RFPs in under 5 minutes"

The technology stack came second. We picked tools based on what would reliably achieve the outcome.

## 2. Human-in-the-loop isn't a cop-out

Full automation sounds impressive, but the most valuable systems we've built include strategic human checkpoints. They:

- Catch edge cases early
- Build trust with users
- Provide training data for improving the system
- Handle truly novel situations gracefully

## 3. Observability from day one

AI systems fail in interesting ways. You need logging for every decision:

```typescript
// Example: Log every AI decision
await logDecision({
  input: userRequest,
  output: agentResponse,
  confidence: 0.87,
  model: "gpt-4",
  latency: 1240,
})
```

This lets you spot patterns, debug failures, and improve the system over time.

## 4. Test with real data immediately

Synthetic test cases are useful, but they don't capture the chaos of real-world data. We push to test with actual customer data within the first week of development.

## 5. Ship small, iterate fast

The best AI systems we've built started as narrow solutions to specific problems, then expanded. A document extraction tool might start with one document type, validate it works, then add more.
